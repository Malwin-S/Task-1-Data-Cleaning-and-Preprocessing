# Task-1-Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing
To prepare the netflix_titles.csv dataset for analysis, several cleaning and preprocessing operations were performed:

Redundant entries were eliminated to maintain data integrity.

Column names were transformed into a uniform, lowercase, underscore-separated style for ease of use.

The date_added column was converted to a datetime object, enabling time-based investigations.

Textual data within the type, country, and rating columns was standardized, including the removal of extra whitespace and application of title casing.

Missing values were addressed.

Data types were verified and adjusted as needed, ensuring release_year was represented as an integer and date_added as a datetime object.
